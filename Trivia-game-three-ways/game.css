Properties and values
At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components:

Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. For example, font-size, width, background-color.
Values: Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.
The example below highlights a single property and value. The property name is color and the value is blue.

A declaration highlighted in the CSS

When a property is paired with a value, this pairing is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are found within CSS Declaration Blocks. In the example below, highlighting identifies the CSS declaration block.

Finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS rulesets (or CSS rules). The example below contains two rules: one for the h1 selector and one for the p selector. The colored highlighting identifies the h1 rule.

Setting CSS properties to specific values is the primary way of defining layout and styling for a document. The CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page.

Important: CSS properties and values are case-sensitive. The property and value in each pair are separated by a colon. (:)

width
background-color
color
border
Important: If a property is unknown, or if a value is not valid for a given property, the declaration is processed as invalid. It is completely ignored by the browser's CSS engine.
CSS @rules provide instruction for what CSS should perform or how it should behave.
Some @rules are simple with just a keyword and a value.
For example,  @import imports a stylesheet into another CSS stylesheet:

@import 'styles2.css';
One common @rule that you are likely to encounter is @media,
which is used to create media queries.
Media queries use conditional logic for applying CSS styling. */
